## Introduction
Revive is a Focus App based on taking care of endangered or extinct species. In Revive, you can take care of a species from 0 to 1, starting with an egg. For your  species to thrive, you need to do anything in a focused way-----such as studying, working, or other activities, which is the core of Revive.
In Revive, you can discover all kinds of endangered or extinct species and revive them with the power of focus. During this journey, you will improve your focus skills, increase your knowledge of species, and finally become the master of revive.

## Features
### Focus
  1. The focus mechanism detects if the user is leaving the application. This prevents the user from doing other things. 
  2. For the timer, users are free to set the time they want to focus on.
  3. There are three kinds of focus approaches: hatching, training and exploring. 
    - Hatching: 
      - Hatching eggs through focus. 
      - Eggs are randomly assigned to the user, and eggs from different types of Secipes take different amounts of time to hatch.
      - Users can choose their own focus time, which is used to reduce the amount of time remaining for the egg to hatch. (In other words, egg hatching doesn't need to be done all at once, it can be done by multiple Focuses)
    - Training: 
      - Training users' own species through focus. 
      - The longer users focus, the higher EXP users' species gain.
    - Exploring: 
      - Exploring through focus. 
      - Users can select a time period for the focus. The exact time is random in the selected time period. 
      - The longer users focus, the higher probability of getting rare items.
